# CMPM121-Final

## Link to the game

The project is now finished and hosted online at the following address:
https://gridfarmer.blujai831.dev

## Team Introduction

Tools Lead: Jaime McCann

Engine Lead: Quinlan Hoang

Design Lead: Anthony Nguyen

## Tools and Materials

Our team plans to continue the use of Deno with its various hook installs and
interfaces that will accelerate game creation and make utlities such as local
host more accessible for debugging and overhauling our code structure. We
decided this as our base framework as we've been using it in class and will
continue to do so for our final project.

We plan to use TypeScript and JSON for our programming and data langauages as
Deno compliments both.

Deno will be used as our main IDE with visual assets being made from various
pixel websites or blendr for 3D assets if we decide to make the game more
immersive.

Our alternate platform would be utilizing JavaScript with Phaser3.

## Outlook

Our team hopes to develop a game that is cohesive and intricately impressive in
which we could add this to our plausible resumes or project portfolios.

We anticipate the hardest of the project being the spatial rules that would
govern plant growth as that, in terms of generation and systematic approach.

We are hoping to accelerate our current TypeScript skills utilizing Deno that we
could use to other generic frameworks that utilize TypeScript or any other
supported languages.
